# Welcome to My GitHub Portfolio

Welcome! I'm a Software Engineering enthusiast with a background in Computer Science and Mathematics from the University of Illinois Urbana - Champaign. This portfolio highlights my journey through various domains of computer science and its practical applications in solving real-world challenges. As I continue to explore and refine my skills, I look forward to discovering and shaping my unique niche in the field.

# Projects

[Drag and Drop Data Manipulation Tool](https://github.com/shouryavpoddar/Drag-and-Drop-Workflow-Builder): The project is designed to simplify complex data workflows, enabling individuals with non-coding backgrounds to explore data science and interact with data effortlessly.

[HackIllinois 2024](https://github.com/Aadityavoru/HackIllinois-2024): Participated in HackIllinois John Deere Hardware Track. Created a BotPatrol. Bot-Patrol is an autonomous vehicle designed to patrol designated areas for enhanced security. Built using Python on a Raspberry Pi, the bot leverages YOLOv8 image recognition for real-time human detection and ultrasound sensors for obstacle identification. Users can define custom patrol paths via a web interface built with Flask, HTML, and CSS. The bot follows the path and detours upon detecting unusual activity. If a human is identified, it moves closer to assess the situation before returning to its original route.
