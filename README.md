# Welcome to My GitHub Portfolio

Welcome! I'm a Software Engineering enthusiast with a background in Computer Science and Mathematics from the University of Illinois Urbana - Champaign. This portfolio highlights my journey through various domains of computer science and its practical applications in solving real-world challenges. As I continue to explore and refine my skills, I look forward to discovering and shaping my unique niche in the field.

# Projects

[Drag and Drop Data Manipulation Tool](https://github.com/shouryavpoddar/Drag-and-Drop-Workflow-Builder): The project is designed to simplify complex data workflows, enabling individuals with non-coding backgrounds to explore data science and interact with data effortlessly.

[HackIllinois 2024](https://github.com/Aadityavoru/HackIllinois-2024): Participated in HackIllinois John Deere Hardware Track. Created a BotPatrol. Bot-Patrol is an autonomous vehicle designed to patrol designated areas for enhanced security. Built using Python on a Raspberry Pi, the bot leverages YOLOv8 image recognition for real-time human detection and ultrasound sensors for obstacle identification. Users can define custom patrol paths via a web interface built with Flask, HTML, and CSS. The bot follows the path and detours upon detecting unusual activity. If a human is identified, it moves closer to assess the situation before returning to its original route.

[Android App - Favorite Places at UIUC](https://github.com/Shreyansh7A/Android_App): Developed an Android application using Android Studio that allows users to add and explore favorite campus spots. The app enables users to view and interact with their friendsâ€™ favorite places, with options to filter locations by category and proximity. Integrated Google Maps API to display locations visually on an interactive map, enhancing the user experience with intuitive navigation and seamless location-based exploration.

[NVIDIA Stock Technical Analysis](https://github.com/Shreyansh7A/Quant/blob/main/NVIDIA_Technical_Analysis.ipynb): Performed a detailed technical analysis of NVIDIA Corporation's stock. Using tools like moving averages, MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence), and Fibonacci retracement levels, I analyzed price trends, identified potential reversal points, and mapped support and resistance levels. This project combines theoretical explanations with practical Python implementations to provide a clear understanding of these technical indicators. It serves as a resource for anyone interested in exploring NVIDIA's stock performance and learning how to apply technical analysis in trading and investment strategies.
