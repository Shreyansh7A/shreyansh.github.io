Created a Mosiac Generator. Steps on how to use it: Upload a folder of images and name it tiles. Upload a base image that you want to convert into a mosaic and name it base_image.png. Clone the repository and run the code, this project will transform the base image using the provided image dataset. This tool is perfect for creating personalized birthday or celebratory posts with stunning, high-quality mosaics. The project leverages Python to handle image loading, color analysis, and tile selection. Using NumPy, it implements distance-based color matching algorithms to analyze the average color of different regions in the base image. An energy function is employed to find the tiles that closely match the average color of these regions, ensuring seamless blending and a visually appealing result.
